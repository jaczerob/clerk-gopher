# clerk-gopher
Clerk Gopher is just a simple command line launcher for Toontown Rewritten I made to learn Golang. It updates your TTR files then logs you into the game. Simple as that.

I provide binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows in the bin folder, however it is only tested on macOS ARM64. If you happen to stumble upon this launcher and find issues with the other operating systems, let me know.

I will be randomly updating this as time goes and I get better at the language and such, but this launcher will only ever update your files and log you into the game.

## Usage

Download the file for your operating system and architecture in the bin folder.

```zsh
# e.g. the macOS ARM64 file
./clerk-gopher-arm64 --username username --password password
```
